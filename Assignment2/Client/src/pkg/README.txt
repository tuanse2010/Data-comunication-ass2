Compile in this order:
Keyboard.java
Comms.java
CommChar.java

then type "java CommChar" to run. Set the program to be a server.
Run a 2nd instance in a different Cmd (DOS) window. Set the program to be a client. The server address is "localhost" or the IP address. 

If you use the COS20012/70007 Data Comms virtual machines:
1. the java path is already set. 
2. In EN310 the VMs can communicate with eachother. That means you can run the program as a client on one VM and as a server on the other. No ports are blocked. 
3. In the lab both VMs can access the internet (select the Data Comms VAN in Virtual Machine Launcher).
4. The Lab VMs include wIRESHARK

IPs:  XP 192.168.100.222
    Win8 192.168.100.227


AT THE MOMENT JAVA IS NOT WORKING CORECTLY IN en310 - USE THE VMs
